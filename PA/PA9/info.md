## Learner Objectives
At the conclusion of this programming assignment, participants should be able to:

* Control position of the cursor on the screen, change the text color
* Define, implement and use a class
 
## Overview and Requirements
The focus of this assignment is to create a class that displays ASCII an image stored in a 2D array on a screen at the user-defined location. The class should have the capability of displaying and erasing the image. This assignment will also require you to create two other files besides your main.cpp.

1. Create three files.

 * `main.cpp` - Client code
 * `image.cpp` - Class implementation file
 * `image.h` - Class declaration/interface file
 
2. In the main.cpp, create a 2D (any size between 5x5 and 12x12) array with the image you like
3. Create an object of the class Image and initialize it using 2D array
4. Move the object around the screen (pick your pattern). At least four different directions should be used
5. Incorporate the color change in your program.

The complexity of your program is up to you.

At a minimum:

* Your class should have at least one private member variable and at least one public member function, and a constructor.
* The image should move on the screen at a reasonable speed for humans to see.
* At least four directions and four colors should be demonstrated.

### Submitting Assignments
* It is VERY IMPORTANT that besides pushing the code to GitHub that you still submit the GitHub URL of this lab assignment in Canvas. This allows the instructor to be notified of your final submission.
