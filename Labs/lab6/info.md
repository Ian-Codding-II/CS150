## Lab 6.1 - Modularizing a Program with `void` Functions
- [ ] Create a `lab6_1.cpp` file. Open the C++ source file `main.cpp` in the text editor and copy the source code below.
```cpp 
 /**
 * @file   WRITE FILE NAME
 * @author WRITE STUDENT NAME
 * @brief  WRITE A COMMENT BRIEFLY DESCRIBING THE PROGRAM.
 * @date   WRITE DATE TODAY

 */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    const double PI = 3.14159;

    int choice = 0;
    while (choice != 4)
    {
        // Display menu
        cout << "Program to calculate areas of objects\n"
             << "        1 -- square\n"
             << "        2 -- circle\n"
             << "        3 -- right triangle\n"
             << "        4 -- quit\n\n";

        // Prompt user to enter a choice from the menu
        cout << "Pick [1-4] from the menu: ";
        cin >> choice;

        double area = 0.0;
        if (choice == 1)
        {
            // Prompt user length of square
            double len = 0.0;
            cout << "Enter length: ";
            cin >> len;

            // Compute for area of square
            area = len * len;
            cout << "Area = " << area << '\n';
        }
        else if (choice == 2)
        {
            // Prompt user for radius of circle
            double rad = 0.0;
            cout << "Enter radius: ";
            cin >> rad;

            // Compute for area of circle
            area = PI * rad * rad;
            cout << "Area = " << area << '\n';
        }
        else if (choice == 3)
        {
            // Prompt user for base and height of the right triangle
            double base = 0.0, height = 0.0;
            cout << "Enter base: ";
            cin >> base;
            cout << "Enter height: ";
            cin >> height;

            // Compute area of right triangle
            area = 0.5 * base * height;
            cout << "Area = " << area << '\n';
        }
        else if (choice != 4)
        {
            cout << "Invalid Menu!\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
   ```
- [ ] Update the header comment with the correct information.
- [ ] Modularize the program by,
   - [ ] Adding the following 4 functions.
      * `void displayMenu()`
      * `void findSquareArea(double length)`
      * `void findCircleArea(double radius)`
      * `void findTriangleArea(double base, double height)`
   
   - [ ] To do that you will need to carry out the following steps:
      - [ ] Write prototypes for the four functions and place them above the `main` function.
      - [ ] Write function definitions (consisting of a function header and initially empty body) for the four functions and place them after the closing brace of the `main` function.
      - [ ] Move the appropriate code out of `main` and into the body of each function.
      - [ ] All of the functions that compute areas will now need to define a variable named `area`.
      - [ ] Move the definition for the named constant `PI` out of `main` and place it above the `main` function and above the function prototypes. This turns the `PI` into a **global variable**.
      - [ ] In `main`, replace each block of removed code with a function call to the function now containing that block of code.
   
- [ ] Compile the code, fixing any errors until it compiles without errors. Then test it. Make sure it runs correctly for all menu choices.

- [ ] Write function header comments for each function. It should be written above each function definition. The function header comment MUST include:
   * a description of what the function does
   * a description of what each parameter is 
   * a description of what the function returns (NOT NEEDED AT THIS PART OF THE LAB)
 - [ ] Commit your code with a message "*lab 6.1 completed*". Recall the terminal commands:
   ```
   $ git add -A
   $ git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE"
   ```
- [ ] Push your code back to the GitHub repo then continue with **Lab 6.2**.


## Lab 6.2 - Using a Function that Returns a Value
- [ ] Create a `lab6_2.cpp` file and copy the source code below.
```cpp 
 /**
 * @file   WRITE FILE NAME
 * @author WRITE STUDENT NAME
 * @brief  This program illustrates how to use a value-returning
 *         function to get, validate, and return input data.
 * @date   WRITE DATE TODAY
 *
 */
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// Function prototype
int getChoice();

int main()
{
    int choice;

    // WRITE A LINE OF CODE TO CALL THE getChoice FUNCTION AND TO
    // ASSIGN THE VALUE IT RETURNS TO THE choice VARIABLE.

    cout << "You entered " << choice << endl;
}

/**
 * @brief This function prompts a user for a input
 *        between 1 to 4 and validates it to ensure
 *        a valid input has been made. Input is then
 *        returned as an integer.
 * 
 * @param NAME_OF_1ST_PARAMETER DESCRIPTION
 * @param NAME_OF_2ND_PARAMETER DESCRIPTION
 * @return int  user choice as an integer between the
 *              values of...
 */
int getChoice()
{
    int input;

    // Get and validate the input
    while (1)
    {
        cout << "Enter an integer between 1 and 4: ";
        cin >> input;

        if (input >= 1 && input <= 4)
        {
            break;
        }
        cout << "Invalid input. ";
    }

    return input;
}
   ```
- [ ] Update the header comment with the correct information.
- [ ] Read through the code to see how it works. Notice that the `getChoice` function validates the input before returning it.

- [ ] Follow the directions given in the uppercase comments in `main`.
   ```
   // WRITE A LINE OF CODE TO CALL THE getChoice FUNCTION AND TO
   // ASSIGN THE VALUE IT RETURNS TO THE choice VARIABLE.
   ```

- [ ] Compile the program and the name of the executable file should be `Lab6_3`. Run the program. When prompted for input, use the test case shown in the sample run below. You should get the same results.
   ```
   Enter an integer between 1 and 4: 0
   Invalid input. Enter an integer between 1 and 4: 9
   Invalid input. Enter an integer between 1 and 4: 2
   You entered 2
   ```

- [ ] Now make the `getChoice` function more versatile so it can validate that a choice is in any desired range, not just 1 â€“ 4. Do this by carrying out the following steps:
   - [ ] Add two integer parameters named `min` and `max` to the function header and modify the function prototype to agree with this.
   - [ ] Revise the function so that it now validates that the input is between `min` and `max`. Remember to change the error prompt as well as the test condition of the `while` loop.
   - [ ] Revise the line of code in `main` that calls the function so that it now passes two arguments to the function.
   - [ ] Pass the values **1** and **4** to the function (though other values would work also).
   - [ ] Now recompile and rerun the program, again using the data from the sample run shown below. The program should produce the same results as it did before.
      ```
      Enter an integer be tween 1 and 4: 0
      Invalid input. Enter an integer between 1 and 4: 9
      Invalid input. Enter an integer between 1 and 4: 2
      You entered 2
      ```
   - [ ] Pass the values **1** and **20** to the function
      ```
      Enter an integer between 1 and 20: 25
      Invalid input. Enter an integer between 1 and 20: 9
      You entered 9
      ```

- [ ] Update the function header comments of `getChoice` to reflect the description of the function, description of the parameters, and the description of what it returns.
- [ ] Commit your code with a message "*lab 6.2 completed*".
- [ ] Push your code back to the GitHub repo then continue with **Lab 6.3**.

## Lab 6.3 - Modularizing a Program with Value-Returning Functions
For this lab exercise, you will make additional improvements to the area's program you worked on in **Lab 6.1**.

- [ ] Create a `lab6_3.cpp` file and copy the code from the completed program in Lab 6.1
- [ ] Update the header comment with the correct information for this lab exercise.
- [ ] Copy the `getChoice` function you just wrote in `lab6_2.cpp` and paste it below the `displayMenu` function definition. 
- [ ] Add a function prototype for the `getChoice` function at the top of the program where the other prototypes are located. Now, change the following line of code in `main`:
   
   ```cpp
   cin >> choice;
   ```
   
   to
   
   ```cpp
   choice = getChoice(1, 4);
   ```
   
   This will ensure that `choice` is assigned a value between 1 and 4. Therefore the final `else if` can be removed from the `if/else if` statement that controls the branching. After doing this, test the program to make sure everything works so far, before going on to the next step.

- [ ] Now, make the `findSquareArea`, `findCircleArea`, and `findTriangleArea` functions into value-returning functions. They should each return a `double` value. Change their function headers and function prototypes to indicate this. Then, instead of having them print the area, have them return the area they have computed.
- [ ] Finally, change the call to each of these functions in the `main` function so that the value returned by the function call will be printed. For example, you will change

   ```cpp
   if (choice == 1)
   {
       // Prompt user length of square
       double len = 0.0;
       cout << "Enter length: ";
       cin >> len;
       
       findSquareArea(len);
   }
   ```
   
   to
   
   ```cpp
   if (choice == 1)
   {
       // Prompt user length of square
       double len = 0.0;
       cout << "Enter length: ";
       cin >> len;
       
       cout << "Area = " << findSquareArea(len) << endl;
   }
   ```

- [ ] Compile the code, fixing any errors until it compiles without errors. Then test it. Make sure it runs correctly for all menu choices. 
- [ ] Commit your code with a message "*lab 6.3 completed*".
- [ ] Do a final push of your code back to the GitHub repo.

## Lab 6.4 - Writing Data to the File
For this lab exercise, you will reuse the functions from  Lab 6.3.

 Copy the code below:
```cpp
/**
 * @file   WRITE FILE NAME
 * @author WRITE STUDENT NAME
 * @brief  WRITE A COMMENT BRIEFLY DESCRIBING THE PROGRAM.
 * @date   WRITE DATE TODAY
 *
 */
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

// INCLUDE FUNCTION PROTOTYPES HERE


const double PI = 3.14159;

int main()
{
    //CREATE A FILE OUTPUT STREAM OBGECT
    
    //OPEN FILE areas.txt
    


    cout << "The program will calculate the area of "
            <<"the square and write it to the file\n";
    // Prompt user to enter a choice from the menu
    double len = 0.0;
    cout << "Enter length: ";
    cin >> len;
    cout << "Area of the square = " << findSquareArea(len)<<endl;
    //WRITE THE ABOVE OUTPUT TO THE FILE
    

    cout << "The program will calculate the area of "
            << "the circle and write it to the file\n";
    // Prompt user for radius of circle
    double rad = 0.0;
    cout << "Enter radius: ";
    cin >> rad;
    cout << "Area of the circle = " << findCircleArea(rad)<<endl;
    //WRITE THE ABOVE OUTPUT TO THE FILE
    

    cout << "The program will calculate the area of "
            <<"the triangle and write it to the file\n";
    // Prompt user for base and height of the right triangle
    double base = 0.0, height = 0.0;
    cout << "Enter base: ";
    cin >> base;
    cout << "Enter height: ";
    cin >> height;
    cout << "Area of the triangle = " << findTriangleArea(base, height)<<endl;
    //WRITE THE ABOVE OUTPUT TO THE FILE
    


    //CLOSE THE FILE
    
    return 0;
}
````
- [ ] Update the header comment with the correct information for this lab exercise.
- [ ] Copy the **findSquareArea**, **findCircleArea**, and **findTriangleArea** functions you wrote from Lab 6.3. Add function prototypes at the top of the program. 
- [ ] Complete the program by following the instructions in the capitalized comments.
